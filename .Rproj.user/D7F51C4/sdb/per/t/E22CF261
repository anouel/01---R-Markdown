You can learn more about `quantmod` at the website [www.quantmod.com](rstudio.github.io/DT/).  \n\n***\n\n<< HISTORICAL PRICE PLOT HERE >>\n\n## Method\n\nThis forecast was predicted with the *recency algorithm*, a simple---probably useless---method for determining stock prices. The recency algorithm predicts that the next price movement, $M_{j}$, will be in the same direction as the most recent price movement. $M_{i}$.\n\n$$M_{i}= Close_{i} - Open_{i}$$\n\n$$\n    M_{j}= \n        \\begin{cases}\n                > 0,  & \\text{if } M_{i} > 0\\\\\n                \\leq 0, & \\text{if } M_{i}\\leq 0\n        \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n## Raw Data\n\nThe table below displays the daily price data for the stock. In the next section, we will learn how to make a concise, interactive table with the `DT` package, a new package for making searchable data tables.
